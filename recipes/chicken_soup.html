        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>4 carrots, halved</li>
        <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken, carrots, celery, and onion in a large soup pot; add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a
            boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until meat falls off of the bone, about 90

        <li>Strain out vegetables, reserving the stock; rinse the soup pot and return the stock to the pot. Chop
            vegetables into smaller pieces; return chopped chicken and vegetables to the pot.</li>
        <li>Warm soup until heated through; season with salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon to taste.</li>
